<br/>HTML and CSS belong to Blizzard
<br/>
<br/><b>App</b>  - uses the blizzard API to look up your account and display all characters/items
<br/>
<br/><b>JS</b>   - I wrote the angularjs from scratch to practice learning angular
<br/><b>HTML</b> - Using Angulars NG-Repeat I was able to delete 90% of the existing HTML
<br/><b>CSS</b>  - I modified the CSS to GET the images once they are called via the search box
