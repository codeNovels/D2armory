<br/><b>HTML and CSS belong to Blizzard</b>
<br/>
<br/><b>App</b> - Uses the blizzard API to look up your account and display all characters/items
<br/><b>JS</b> - I wrote the angularjs from scratch to practice learning angular controllers | filters | $http | DirectInjection
<br/><b>HTML</b> - Using Angulars NG-Repeat and ternary operators, I was able to delete 90% of blizzards existing HTML
<br/><b>CSS</b>  - I modified the CSS to GET the images once they are called via the search box
