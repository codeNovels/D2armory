<br/>*HTML and *CSS belong to Blizzard
<br/>
<br/>This application uses the blizzard API to look up your account and display all characters/items
<br/>
<br/>HTML - Using Angulars NG-Repeat I was able to delete 90% of the existing HTML
<br/>CSS- I modified the CSS to GET the images once they are called via  the search box
<br/>JS - I wrote the angularjs  from scratch to practice learning angular
