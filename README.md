# d2armory
Uses the blizzard api to look up your account and display all characters/items
Type the battleTag# in the search  field to retrieve a JSON object back.

*HTML and CSS belong to Blizzard*
Using Angulars NG-Repeat I was able to delete 90% of the existing HTML
I modified the CSS to GET the images once they are called via  the search box
I wrote the javascript to practice angularjs.
